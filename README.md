# Angular and Node seed app with gulp workflow!
Setup commands:
`npm install`
`npm install -g gulp` (if don't have gulp)
`gulp build`

Running locally/Dev setup:
* Run `node server.js` from project root
* Run `gulp` from project root (while leaving step 1 so will need two tabs)
* It is now running at http://localhost:3002/
* Any changes to js files will automatically be rebundled on the fly
